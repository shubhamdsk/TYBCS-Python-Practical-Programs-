# 3. Write a Python function to check whether a number is perfect or not.

def perfect_number(n):
    sum = 0
    for x in range(1, n):
        if n % x == 0:
            sum += x
    return sum == n
print(perfect_number(6))

"""
The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. The next perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. This is followed by the perfect numbers 496 and 8128.
